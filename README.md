# LG_DX_School_BX_project

<P> Good sleep, Good life </P>

### Project Outline

The LG Electronics BX Project aims to enhance customer engagement by leveraging our diverse industry portfolio. We are focused on solving the challenge of increasing touchpoints with LG Electronics' customers. Our approach involves developing a smart mattress product to address this issue.

## Environment

- Java must be installed to use the konlp packages (for extracting Korean nouns for word clouds).
- The stopword.txt file contains Korean stop words.
- The requirements.txt file should include all the Python libraries that your notebooks rely on, and these libraries will be installed using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- In some cases, the word cloud for Korean text may appear with corrupted fonts. To resolve this issue, use the NanumGothic.ttf font file from NanumFontSetup_TTF_GOTHIC. For more details, refer to wordcloud_policy.ipynb.
